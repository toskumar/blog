## What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a form of AI (Artificial Intelligence) that enables a system to learn from Data.

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so

## Machine Learning approaches
- Supervised learning
  - Presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
- Unsupervised learning
  -  No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end
- Reinforcement learning
  - interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent)
