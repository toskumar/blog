## What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a form of AI (Artificial Intelligence) that enables a system to learn from Data.

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so

## Machine Learning approaches
- Supervised learning
  - Presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
  - Supervised learning refers to using a set of input variables to predict the value of a labeled output variable.
- Unsupervised learning
  -  No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end
- Reinforcement learning
  - is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action. The agent learns automatically with these feedbacks and improves its performance.
  - interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent)
  
- Supervised Learning Classification
  - Binary classification - predicting one of two possible outcomes eg., is an email a spam or not
  - Multiclass classification - predicting one of more than two outcomes eg., is a product a book, movie, or mobile
  - Regression - predicting a numeric value eg., What will be the temperature in Delhi tomorrow
  
- Unsupervised Learning Classfication
  - Clustering
  - Association

## Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning 
AI is a bigger concept to create intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking capability and behavior, whereas, machine learning is an application or subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data without being programmed explicitly.
- AI Types
  - Weak AI
  - General AI
  - Strong AI

## Machine Learning Life Cycle (G-P-W-A-T-T-D)
  - Gathering data - identify data sources, collect data and combine data.
  - Data preparation - randomize the ordering of data, data exploration (understand the characteristics, format the data and quality of data), data pre-processing.
  - Data Wrangling - cleaning and converting raw data into useable format, remove missing values, duplicate and invalid data.
  - Analyse data - select the analytical techniques(classification, regression, cluster, association), building the model and review the result.
  - Train the Model - Use dataset to train the model using various machine learning algorithm so that it can understand the various patterns, rules and features.
  - Test the Model - Once our machine learning model has been trained on a given dataset, then we test the model for accuracy.
  - Deployment - The last step of machine learning life cycle is deployment, where we deploy the model in the real-world system.
