# Data Analysis and Visualization

### Relationships
Visualizing relationships in your data can provide a good general overview, show distribution, and correlation between attributes. Visualizing relationships can also help find outliers and extreme values.

* Scatter Plots : Also known as scatter charts. These graphs plot points along the x and y axis for two values. Example: Is there any relationship between the size of a home and the price ?
* Bubble Plots: Also known as bubble charts. These graphs plot points along the x and y axis for three values. Bubble size is the third value measured. Example: Are there any relationship between the size of a home, the age of the home and the price?
* Types of Correlation : Positive correlation, Negative correlation, No correlation
* SageMaker, Jupyter notebook and R is the developer tool
* Amazon QuickSight, Tableau is a BI tool for visualizing data

### Comparisons
Visualizing comparisons in your data can provide a static snapshot of how different variables compare and show how different variables change over time.
* Bar Charts: are graphs that use line (bars) to mark single variable values. Provides a way to lookup and compare values. Example: comparing the number of star rating for a mobile application in the app store.
* Line Charts: are graphs that use lines to show one or more variables changing over time. Example: Plotting the price of Bitcoin over the past 3 years.

### Distributions
Visualizing distributions in your data can show how your data is grouped or clustered over certain intervals.
* Histograms: These graphs put values into buckets or bins and determines a measurement (amount, frequency, duration, density etc). Example: Showing the distribution of test scores for a given exam.
* Box Plots: These graphs show a wealth of distribution information. You can see things like lowest and highest values, outlier and where most of the values fall. Example: Showing the distribution of test scores for a given exam
  * The box in a box plot represents 50% of the data, or the middle quartile. The line in the box represents the median. The upper/far right of the box plot represents the upper quartile. The lower/left of the box represents the lower quartile.
* Scatter Plots: Also known as scatter charts. These graphs plot points along the x and y axis for two values. Can show clustering and distribution of your data. Example: Showing the return of investment (ROI) for a amount of money spend and the total time invested.

### Compositions
Visualizing composition of your data how the various elements and what your data is made of.
* Pie Charts: show how various values compare as a whole, share of the total. Example: Showing the sales figures for each region.
* Stacked Area Charts: shows the the measurement of various items over longer periods of time. Example: Showing the number of products sold by different departments on a weekly basis.
* Stacked Column Charts: also knows as stacked bar charts. These graphs show quantity of various items over shorter periods of time. Example: Showing the quarterly revenue totals for each region.

### Heatmaps 
Heatmap are graphs that represent values as color. As the values change, the color representation of the data changes too.
