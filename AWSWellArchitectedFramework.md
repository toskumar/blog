# Well Architected Framework

## 5 Pillars of Well Architected Framework are
- [Operational Excellence](#1-operational-excellence)
- [Security](#2-security)
- [Reliability](#3-reliability)
- [Performance Efficiency](#4-performance-efficiency)
- [Cost Optimization](#5-cost-optimization)

### 1. Operational Excellence
The operational excellence pillar includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.
**Design Principles**
There are six design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:
- Perform operations as code
- Annotate documentation
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

### 2. Security
The security pillar includes the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

**Design Principles**
There are six design principles for security in the cloud:

- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Prepare for security events

### 3. Reliability
The reliability pillar includes the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

**Design Principles**
There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:

- Test recovery procedures
- Automatically recover from failure
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

### 4. Performance Efficiency
The performance efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. 

**Design Principles**
There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:

- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Mechanical sympathy

### 5. Cost Optimizatization
The cost optimization pillar includes the ability to avoid or eliminate unneeded cost or suboptimal resources. 

**Design Principles**
There are five design principles for cost optimization in the cloud:

- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on data center operations
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
- Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership
